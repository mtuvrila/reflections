When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  1 when share my work with others
  2 to have acces to repository from diff computers/locations
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	that gives the control on when you want to be synched whith, maybe I am working on something ritgh now and don't want to be disturbed by someone elses worok on github

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-  fork is a clone but only on GitHUB
- clones - clone a repositories with history and all changes. 
- branche is used to modify existing data without changing the working copy. It allows to do the changes without broken something

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	I can see the benefit in case when working offline, cause to check diff betwenn local and remote branch is better
