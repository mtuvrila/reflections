This is my introduction cours within udacity, will see how it is
1 Software is creating writing the code, as a natural work, we can try repeat undo the things, but it is really hard to keep all of those tracking. 
See diff between 'tries' is essential to find 'bugs'

2. check the difference, see where I ve got wrong decision
3. Probably as a programmer you better know when is the point to make commit [task end, bug fix ...]
4. Different purposes: one for code with multiple changes, another for editing one document.
5. 
6. alway have the history of changes , at any time can check what was changed
7 Change svn to git
